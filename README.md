# Databel Churn Analysis
Databel is a fictitious telecom company. For this case study I created multi-paged reports to analyze customer churn and find the main factors driving this churn.

## Files
**churn_insights_overview:** Some key, but simple, customer churn insights. Discovering how the churn rate is geographically spread, and the main reasons churned customers cite.
**churn_analysis:** A report with many insightful visuals across multiple pages to provide a detailed analysis of customer churn. The visuals show the churn rate spread across geography, demographics, customer service plans and customer groups.
**Databel - Data**: The data file. CSV type.
